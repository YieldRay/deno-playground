Thanks to the following libraries for making this project possible:

- [`monaco-editor`](https://github.com/microsoft/monaco-editor): The code editor
- [`xterm.js`](https://github.com/xtermjs/xterm.js): The terminal emulator

Of course, this project also relies on other libraries, which are listed in the package.json file.
